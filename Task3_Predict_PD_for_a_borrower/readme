# Task 3 - Predict the PD (Probability of default) for a borrower

**Aim**
Use the provided data to train a function that will estimate the probability of default for a borrower.

**Objectives**
1. Produce a function that can take in the properties of a loan and output the  expected loss.
2. Explore some technique including
> * Simple regression: -- Accuracy of the Logistic Regression model is:  0.99; Accuracy of Logisitic Regression model after replace variable is: 0.9979 
> * XGBoost: -- Accuracy of the XGBoost is 0.9998
> * Random forest: -- Accuracy of the Random Forest model is 0.9997


3. Use multiple methods and provide a comparative analysis.

**Raw data info:**
- borrower
- income
- total loans outstanding
- Previsouly defaulted on a loan
- Assuming a recovery rate of 10%, this can be used to give the expected loss on a loan.
