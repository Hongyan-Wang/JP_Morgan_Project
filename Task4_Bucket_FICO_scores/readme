# Task 4: Bucket FICO scores

Charlie wants to build a **machine learning model** that will predict the probability of default, but while you are discussing the methodology, she mentions that the architecture she is using requires `*categorical data*`. As FICO ratings can take integer values in a large range, they will need to be mapped into `*buckets*`.

**Defination**

> Founders: Bill Fair/ Earl Isaac

A FICO score is a standardized credit score created by the Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) that quantifies the creditworthiness of a borrower to a value between 300 to 850, based on various factors.

FICO scores are used in 90% of mortgage application decisions in the United States.

**Task**

The risk manager provides you with FICO scores for the borrowers in the bankâ€™s portfolio and wants you to **construct a technique for predicting the PD (probability of default)** for the borrowers using these scores.

- **Aim**
> - Create a rating map that maps the FICO score of the borrowers to a rating where a lower rating signifies a better credit score.
> - You could consider many ways of solving the problem by optimizing different properties of the resulting buckets, such as the mean squared error or log-likelihood

* The process of doing this is known as quantization.

* The simplest way to quantize a signal is to choose the digital amplitude value closest to the original analog amplitude. This example shows the original analog signal (green), the quantized signal (black dots), the signal reconstructed from the quantized signal (yellow) and the difference between the original signal and the reconstructed signal (red). The difference between the original signal and the reconstructed signal is the quantization error and, in this simple quantization scheme, is a deterministic function of the input signal.
